# GemAI
This is GemAI. An AI app that uses ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude, and DeepSeek APIs to connect to these models in a streamlined polished SwiftUI design.


# Get your API key/keys. You dont need to add all 3, to obtain the keys, I will put links.
## Perplexity: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/getting-started (adding perplexity is worth it if you have Pro, because Pro users get free 5 dollah dollah bonus each month. One request is: 1 cent.
## Gemini: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey (Gemini, you have to click create API key, this is free.)
## ChatGPT: (I have never tested ChatGPT because I didnt pay for my key, therefore it's not free) Pricing: https://openai.com/api/pricing/ API key page: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

## Once you have the keys you want to add (again, not necessary to add all) open GemAI, and click each box and type in your key/keys. The keys you don't want to add you can click the skip button. Once you typed in your keys, click "Get Started". You have set up GemAI correctly, you can start using GemAI.
